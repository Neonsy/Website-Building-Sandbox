# Website Building Sandbox

Hey there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my repository, where I'm improving my responsive web design skills from time to time.
This repo is all about practice and experimentation.

## Goal

I want to use technologies like React and Tailwind to primarily build "normal" websites, with basic features _if needed_.

## Tech Stack

For now, I'm keeping it simple:

-   **React**: Because I wanna keep on using it
-   **NextJS**: Because I want more experiance with it and V15 is out
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Because as I'm writing this, there is no better option.

> [!NOTE]
> These are the technologies for the start, but hey may change over time.

## Project Goals

1. **Practice, practice, practice**: Build a variety of sites
2. **Experiment**: Try out different approaches and see what works best
3. **Learn**: Discover new techniques and best practices for responsive design

## Current Projects

**_Coming soon!_**
